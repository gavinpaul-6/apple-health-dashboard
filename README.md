<h2>Summary</h2>
Dashboards in Splunk are user-friendly graphical interfaces that provide a visual representation of data collected and analyzed by Splunk. They are a central component of the Splunk platform and are used to present real-time or historical data, key performance indicators (KPIs), and insights to users in a concise and meaningful way. Splunk dashboards help users make informed decisions, monitor system health, troubleshoot issues, and gain actionable insights from their data.

<h2>Resources Used</h2>

- Splunk Enterprise (Free trial)
- PowerShell

<h2>Training:</h2>

I started my journey through a combination of structured training and hands-on practice. Leveraging Splunk's official training platform, I delved into comprehensive courses and modules designed to equip me with the skills needed to harness the full potential of this tool. Next, I also enrolled in Hailie Shaw's ["Zero to Power User" Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/splunk-zero-to-power-user/), where I gained insights and practical knowledge from a seasoned Splunk expert. To reinforce my learning, I dedicated ample time to hands-on practice using TutorialData, honing my ability to navigate through Splunk's data management, search, and visualization features. This was great preparation for the Splunk Core Certified Power User exam.

<h2>Converting XML file to CSV</h2>
After successfully saving the document onto my desktop and unzipping the file, I opened PowerShell and ran a Python script created byÂ [Test-Driven Data Analysis](http://www.tdda.info/) to convert the data from XML format to CSV.

<h2>Creating an Index and uploading data</h2>
I started off by creating an index and an app. I then uploaded the data that I wanted to create the visualization for. For simplicity I chose StepCount.csv

<h2>Running Searches</h2>

Now that the data was uploaded I was able to run searches to query data. For example, this search explains the date of when I took my first steps.

After running the search for the data I was looking for I saved it as a dashboard.

Utilizing the training I learned from Splunk's official website and Hailie's Splunk course,. I was able to customize and build out my dashboard to how I wanted.
